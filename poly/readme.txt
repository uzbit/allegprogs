This program will allow you to input the coeficients of a polynomial
up to the 100th degree. As you may know the 0th degree is the y intersept.
Just so you know, a polynomial can be written in the form of:
( a^n*x^n ) + (a^n-1*x^n-1)... + (a^0*x^0). After you
are prompted for the degree, you will be prompted for the coeficients
of the polynomial (which are the a^nth above), and then the x and y max.

The screen resolution is set to 640x480.  When you view the
graph you will be able to zoom in and zoom out (+,- on the number pad).
when the hash marks get to 1 on the screen the graph will pause for
a key press and you will be prompted to run the program again or exit,
if you are done viewing the graph push any key and you will be
prompted the same question.
...Enjoy the program.

This program was written with borland graphics interface.
So you may modify the code if you wish.
